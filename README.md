# Home Bike Repair Solutions 🚲🔧

A full stack web application designed to provide home based bike repair assistance

This project is developed as a **Final Year Major Project**.


## 📌 Problem Statement
Two-wheeler users often face difficulties in finding reliable repair information and skilled mechanics, especially in semi-urban and urban areas.  
Existing solutions lack a centralized platform that combines repair guidance, spare parts information, and mechanic discovery.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide category-wise bike repair guides  
- Help users find nearby mechanics based on expertise  
- Offer spare parts search with pricing (mock data)  
- Create a simple and user-friendly interface  
- Demonstrate full stack web development concepts  


## ⚙️ Key Features
- Bike category selection (Daily commuter,sport,ADV and crusier)
- Repair guides specific to bike type
- Spare parts search with cart functionality
- Mechanics directory with ratings
- Mechanic registration through backend API
- Role-based structure (User / Mechanic / Admin – basic)


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Front end
- React.js  
- Axios  

### Back end
- Node.js  
- Express.js  

### Database
- Local JSON files (for simulation)


## 🧱 System Architecture
- React frontend communicates with Express backend using REST APIs  
- Backend handles repair guides, mechanics, and parts data  
- JSON data is used to simulate database operations  


## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- MongoDB or MySQL integration  
- Real time location-based mechanic search  
- Online booking and payment system  
- User authentication with JWT  
- Mobile application version  


## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`  
3. Start backend server using `npm start`  
4. Start frontend using `npm run dev`  
5. Open browser and access the application
